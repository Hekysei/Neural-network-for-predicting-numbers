# Neural-network-for-predicting-numbers
### Brief description of the task that this code solved
**Time series forecast**
- Use a time series [ts_prediction.csv](https://github.com/Hekysei/Neural-network-for-predicting-numbers/blob/main/ts_prediction.csv) with values ​​from 0 to 74.
- Try to predict values ​​from 75 to 99.
- Solve the problem without using the libraries _prophet_, _catboost_, _xgboost_, etc.
